# The Datuk Corpus
 The Datuk corpus is a free and open source Malayalamâ€“Malayalam dictionary dataset with over 106,000 
 definitions for more than 83,000 Malayalam words. It is an extensively refined and semanticized 
 version of Datuk's original digitisation work incorporating tens of thousands of changes. 
 The majority of words and definitions are grammar tagged, and a large number of records 
 also have additional metadata attached to them.
